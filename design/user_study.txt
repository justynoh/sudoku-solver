                                   User Study
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Based on the user study, the following changes were suggested:

 -  To put a “please hold still” or an “increase your brightness” message.
 -  To put guesses (via backtracking) in a different color from the others when
    showing the solutions.
 -  To improve on the digit recognition.
 -  To include the ability to recognize different size boards.
 -  To move the buttons slightly higher.
 -  To make the step of ‘changing the numbers’ more obvious that screen was for
    that purpose.

Implemented changes:

 -  An “increase your brightness” message was put in.
 -  Headings were included in each screen for clarity of purpose in general.
 -  To give a 4x4 option in addition to the 9x9 option.

Could be improved:

 -  To include more puzzles, or automatically detect if a Sudoku is 4x4 or 9x9.
